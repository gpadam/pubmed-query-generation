0,1,dev,2,Opioid Treatments for Chronic Pain,"Key Question 1. Effectiveness and Comparative Effectiveness a. In patients with chronic pain, what is the effectiveness of opioids versus placebo or no opioid for outcomes related to pain, function, and quality of
life after short-term followup (1 to <6 months), intermediate-term followup (6 to <12 months), and long-term followup (≥12 months)? 3 b. How does effectiveness vary depending on: (1) the specific type or
cause of pain (e.g., neuropathic, musculoskeletal [including low back pain], visceral pain, fibromyalgia, sickle cell disease, inflammatory pain, headache disorders, and degree of nociplasticity); (2) patient demographics (e.g., age, race, ethnicity, gender, socioeconomic status); (3) patient comorbidities (including past or current alcohol or substance use disorders, mental health disorders, medical comorbidities, and high risk for opioid use disorder); (4) the mechanism of action of opioids used (e.g., pure opioid agonists, partial opioid agonists such as buprenorphine, or drugs with mixed opioid and nonopioid mechanisms of action such as tramadol or tapentadol)? c. In patients with chronic pain, what is the comparative effectiveness of opioids versus nonopioid therapies (pharmacologic or nonpharmacologic, including cannabis) on outcomes related to pain, function, and quality of life after short-term followup (1 to <6 months), intermediate-term followup (6 to <12 months), and long-term followup (≥12 months)?
d. In patients with chronic pain, what is the comparative effectiveness of opioids plus nonopioid interventions (pharmacologic or nonpharmacologic, including cannabis) versus opioids or nonopioid interventions alone on outcomes related to pain, function, quality of life, and doses of opioids used after short-term followup (1 to <6 months), intermediate-term followup (6 to <12 months), and long-term followup (≥12 months)?
